All four axes in the 4-dimensional GNMDS ordination of the KS457 dataset
were confirmed by DCA. GNMDS ordination had Procrustes SS = 0.0363 and
seven unstable OUs (which switched positions between the two best GNMDS
solutions).

There were no visible artifacts in the ordination charts. The
correlation analysis, the vector charts and the iso-line charts show a
strong first axis related to land use (infrastructure and agricultural
character) that appears to be conditioned by an underlying
geo-ecological gradient from inner to outer coast. Second axis is
strongly related to relief.

Complementary observations, axis 1 and 2: - One OU belongs to OI Class 6
(big city). This is Id 2916 Oslo city, which occupies the extreme
position along GNMDS axis 1. - Agricultural intensity is associated with
positive scores for GNMDS 1, and a certain degree of infrastructure
(similar to IfI ≈ 4) is a prerequisite for amount/degree of agricultural
land use intensity. The relationship between JI and IfI is slightly
unimodal, that is, the agricultural land use intensity is strongest when
the amount/degree of infrastructure is relatively high, but decreases
again when the amount/degree of infrastructure is very high. - The
proportion of the area with deciduous forest (Arlov\_a) is 0 at the
outer parts of the archipelago (SN = 5; there are 156 OUs with Arlov =
0), but increases inward towards larger islands and on the mainland. -
The figure at the bottom left shows a clear (inverse) island size
gradient, with a considerable variation in landscape characteristics
related to the archipelago properties, first and foremost when the
islands are smaller than 100 km2 (Oyst\_i \> 0.643). This opens the
possibility that the complex gradient expressed on axis 1 is actually
composed of two CLGs. - Among the 69 OUs in KS lacking infrastructure
(IfI = 0), all of the 56 as a largest island smaller than 1 km. Islands
with significant infrastructure are generally much larger; one exception
is Id 4038 which has Oyst\_i = 0.8647 and IfI = 9.34. This polygon is
located on the west and south part of Nøtterøy. - It is noteworthy that
the topographic variables give such a strong signal when there is so
little topography variation within costal plains.
